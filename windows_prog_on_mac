You can now use IrfanView!
Try WineBottler <http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/downloads>

This free software is a wrapper for WINE, which unlike other Windows emulators is really simple to set up.
It just works.

1- download WineBottler from the above site, and install it.
2- Download the latest version of IrfanView (4.25)
3- Start WineBottler and Create a Custom Prefix
4- For the Install File, select the IrfanView installation file you just downloaded
5- In the Winetricks section select vc6run
6- Click Install

You'll then see a standard Windows installation - follow the prompts.
BTW- at the end there's a pop-up, from which you should select ivew32.exe as the executable to run. Obvious but worth mentioning.

That's it! WineBottler generates an Irfanview App that can by launched like any Mac App.
