### Step 1: Update Homebrew

Before you install anything with Homebrew, you should always make sure it's up to date and that it's healthy:

$ brew update
$ brew doctor

### Step 2: Install Postgres

$ brew install postgresql

When you install Postgres, you will see a bunch of output in your Terminal. The important sections are Build Notes, Create/Upgrade a Database, and Start/Stop PostgreSQL. Make sure to follow those instructions to the letter.
